  Mechanized (machine-checked) proofs of the article's statements.

  Each fact re-states a statement from @{file "pss_paper.thy"} (where it is
  recorded as @{command sorry}) and discharges it with a real proof.  This is
  the "own work" file; the goal is to contain no @{command sorry}.  Facts not
  yet mechanized are marked with a \<open>TODO\<close> comment and a temporary
  @{command sorry}.

  Naming mirrors @{file "pss_paper.thy"} with prefix \<open>m_\<close> instead of \<open>p_\<close>.

lemma Pred_preserves_T_PS:
  assumes "M \<in> T_PS"
  shows "Pred M \<in> T_PS"
proof (cases "Lng M \<le> 1")
  case True
  thus ?thesis using assms by (simp add: Pred_def)
next
  case False
  hence "butlast M \<noteq> []" by (simp add: length_greater_0_conv [symmetric])
  thus ?thesis using False by (simp add: T_PS_def Pred_def)

lemma Lng_Pred_lt:
  assumes "Lng M > 1"
  shows "Lng (Pred M) < Lng M"
  using assms by (simp add: Pred_def)

lemma le0_refl:
  assumes "j < Lng M"
  shows "le0 M j j"
  using assms by (simp add: le0_def)

lemma leR_refl:
  assumes "i \<in> {0,1}" "j < Lng M"
  shows "leR M i j j"

lemma take_append_map_nth:
  assumes "i \<le> j" "j \<le> length xs"
  shows "take i xs @ map (nth xs) [i..<j] = take j xs"
proof -
  have "take (j - i) (drop i xs) = map (nth xs) [i..<j]"

  moreover have "take j xs = take i xs @ take (j - i) (drop i xs)"
